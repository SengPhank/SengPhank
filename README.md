## Hey there! 👋

- I'm a 2nd year *Computer Science* student studying at Adelaide University.
- I have experience mainly with languages C++ and Python
- Currently trying to race against AI so I won't be replaced so easily! 💪

About Me:
<br>
Discovering a new way of expressing my curiosity at 15, I began developing mini-projects in my own time using Python. My passion for computational thinking allowed me to convert creativity into code!
